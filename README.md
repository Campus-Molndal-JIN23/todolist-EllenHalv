# Java Todo List Application

## Description

The motivation for this project was to practice the use of Java and SQL and creating tests for the application to ensure that it works as intended.

The application allows the user to create a todo list and perform CRUD operations on the list. The application also allows the user to search for a specific todo item and edit or delete that item.

I learned how to use Java and SQL to create a todo list application. I also learned how to create tests for the application to ensure that it works as intended, as well as using GitHub CI.
